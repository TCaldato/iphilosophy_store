# Introduction

## About the Project Iphilosophy Store

A Full-Stack E-commerce was developed for this project, which utilizes business logic to manage a centralized dataset. A role-based access authentication mechanism was implemented to ensure secure access to the website's data. The website was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and the Django and Bootstrap frameworks, payments are made using Stripe and Postgres serving as the relational database. An Agile approach was employed throughout the project. The project also involved the implementation of authorization, authentication, and permission features in a Full-Stack web application solution. Furthermore, the project utilized object-based software concepts to achieve its goals.

## UX

### User-Stories

In the Agile approach, a "user story" is a technique that assists in capturing the user's perspective and needs. It is a simple, yet powerful tool that shifts the focus from documenting requirements to discussing them. A user story is a brief, informal description from a user's point of view that explains what they want to achieve with the product. It encourages collaboration between the development team and the user, as it sparks meaningful conversations about the features and functionality that the user story represents. This approach promotes a better understanding of the user's needs, resulting in a product that meets their requirements and delivers value to the user.

The Agile User Story technique has been documented in a separate file. You can check by on [Agile file](AGILE.md)

### Design Thinking

In order to optimize user experience on the developed website, it is important to apply a Design Thinking approach to determine the most useful features. However, given the time constraints of a hard deadline, it is necessary to assess the feasibility of a student developer delivering prioritized features. It is worth mentioning that the project must incorporate CRUD functionality, as per the assessment criteria, which provides a broad outline of the fundamental requirements.

During a preliminary brainstorming session, a few ideas were suggested to enhance the website's user experience:

| Feature                                 | Importance | Feasibility |
|:----------------------------------------|:----------:|:-----------:|
| Create personal account                 | 5          | 5           |
| Update account information              | 5          | 5           |
| Access easily the site products         | 5          | 5           |





| **Overall Score**                       | **0**     | **0**      |

The analysis of the feasibility and importance scores indicates that the project is both practically achievable and highly valuable. Therefore, based on the data, the project is deliverable.

### Intuitive Design

### Database Design

When working with Django, it's important to have a clear understanding of the database architecture before creating models. This is where Entity Relationship Diagrams come in handy as they allow you to visualize the relationships between different tables. By doing so, it is possible save valuable time later on in the project by avoiding the need to recode.
